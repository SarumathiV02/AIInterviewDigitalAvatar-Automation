About Us and our Deceased Notification Services
We are an estate registry and notification services company. Our primary business is the provision of Deceased Notification Services to facilitate communication between a Decedent’s Estate and its Creditors to resolve open or outstanding accounts of the Decedent as of the time of passing and are part of the estate. This communication is facilitated by the submittal of certain Estate Information by a Notifier and the sharing of such information with our Subscribers and other Creditors. Creditors, in turn, are then able to communicate directly with the Notifier to resolve any open or outstanding accounts of the Decedent’s Estate. Notifiers may also be provided contact information regarding such Creditors. Our Website serves as a platform and registry that contains Estate Information that is reasonably necessary to provide and facilitate the provision of our Deceased Notification Services and the resolution of open or outstanding accounts. In addition, certain Creditors that are Subscribers may also provide us with factual, personal, and account-related information regarding their customers (including account numbers) who they have reason to believe have passed away, enabling us to potentially match and corroborate such information with Estate Information submitted to the Website by Notifiers.

Information Collection and Sharing Practices
The Deceased Notification Services we offer to our Subscribers (and other Creditors) includes the disclosure and sharing of certain information about Notifiers, Decedents and/or a Decedent’s Estate that is voluntarily submitted by a Notifier and registered on our Website (i.e., Estate Information). More particularly, we compile and assemble the information provider by Notifiers and our Subscribers, along with public record information, with respect to each Decedent’s Estate. In return, our Subscribers (and other Creditors) are authorized and able to access such information pursuant to the consent provided by a Notifier and/or applicable data privacy legislation. As is clear from the nature of our business, we regularly collect, use, disclose and share Estate Information regarding Notifiers and Decedent’s Estates, including account-related information of Decedents, and disclose and share such information with our Subscribers and other Creditors.

We primarily collect personal and other information regarding yourself (as a Notifier), Decedent, or a Decedent’s Estate from the following sources:

• Information about you or a Decedent that is provided to us by Creditors or other institutions that are either responsible for obtaining your prior consent to provide such information to us or otherwise permitted to disclose such information under applicable law.
We limit the collection of personal information regarding a Notifier and Decedent to include only what is reasonably necessary to provide our Subscribers and other Creditors with the accurate and up-to-date information they need to make meaningful decisions and in order to facilitate the resolution of outstanding accounts of their particular customers who have passed away.The information we collect and share with respect to a Notifier generally relates to contact information to facilitate Creditor communication. We periodically review the data we have collected to delete information that is not relevant to the services we provide or the needs of our Subscribers or other Creditors in general.

Creditors or other business in this situation must also provide individuals who are declined credit with the contact information to the relevant credit reporting agency so that the individual can verify the content of his or her credit file and, if necessary, request that information be amended or deleted.
